# Week 0 â€” Billing, Architecture and Sercurity
## Prerequirements
I was able to install the following cloud services or requierements:

1. Github: Created an account and copied Andrew's store application by creating a new repository with the following name: aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023, and make sure that the repo is public.
2. Gitpod:Created an account and installed gitpod browser extension. Note: this will only work with Google Chrome.
4. Github Codespaces: Instead of Cloud Developer Enviroment in AWS, you will Github Codespaces to maintein into the free tier.
5. AWS account: I already had an AWS account. Note: It is required a credit card to active an account even though AWS has a free tier.
6. Momento: Opened an account.
7. Domain name: Bought a domain name, I personally recommend IONOS website because it is really cheap. You can find domain for a $1.
8. Lucidchart: Created an account, the account is free but you are only allow to build 3 diagrams and I also installed a bundled AWS Icon set. 
9. HonyComb.io: Created an account for distributed tracing.
10. Rollbar: Created an account to tracking bugs when application crashes, uncaught errors and slow response to make it easily debug production applications.

# Homework
## User security

I setuped the MFA for the root and my personal IAM user because enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in AWS is an important security measure that helps protect your account from unauthorized access. MFA adds an extra layer of security to the login process by requiring not only a username and password, but also a unique code that is generated by a separate device or application.

By enabling MFA, you can greatly reduce the risk of someone gaining access to your account, even if they have your username and password. MFA makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to your account, as they would need physical access to your MFA device or application in addition to your login credentials.

AWS recommends that all users enable MFA on their accounts, particularly on accounts with administrative privileges. In fact, some AWS services require MFA for certain actions or API calls. Enabling MFA can also help you meet compliance requirements for security and data protection.

# AWS Services Limits
These are the most common Service limits in AWS ant the RDS seems more like to be a service that I would open the ticket, because it is more related to our project
