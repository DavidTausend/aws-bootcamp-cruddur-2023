# Week 0 â€” Billing, Architecture and Sercurity
## Prerequirements
I was able to install the following cloud services or requierements:

1. Create Github: I copied Andrew's store application by creating a new repository with the following name: aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023, and make sure that the repo is public.
2. Create Gitpod: I installed gitpod browser extension. Note: this will only work with Google Chrome.
4. Create Github Codespaces: Instead of Cloud Developer Enviroment in AWS, you will Github Codespaces to maintein into the free tier.
5. AWS account: I already had an AWS account. Note: It is required a credit card to active an account even though AWS has a free tier.
6. Momento: Opened an account.
7. Domain name: Bought a domain name, I personally recommend IONOS website because it is really cheap. You can find domain for a $1.
8. Create Lucidchart: The account is free but you are only allow to build 3 diagrams and I also installed a bundled AWS Icon set. 
9. Create HonyComb.io: Created an account for distributed tracing.
10. Create Rollbar: Created an account to tracking bugs when application crashes, uncaught errors and slow response to make it easily debug production applications.

For guidance I watched the following videos:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv

# Homework 
## User security and credentials

I setuped the MFA for the root and my personal IAM user because enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in AWS is an important security measure that helps protect my account from unauthorized access. MFA adds an extra layer of security to the login process by requiring not only a username and password, but also a unique code that is generated by a separate device or application.

By enabling MFA, there is greatly reduce the risk of someone gaining access to your account, even if a hack has my username and password. MFA makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to your account, as they would need physical access to your MFA device or application in addition to your login credentials.

AWS recommends that all users enable MFA on their accounts, particularly on accounts with administrative privileges. In fact, some AWS services require MFA for certain actions or API calls. Enabling MFA allows meeting compliance requirements for security and data protection.

I also took the change to create a Administrators group and gave the AdministratorAccess role to be more organised, that way I can distribute the roles within groups to the necessary users (best security practices).

## Health notifications

I was able hookup Health Dashboard to SNS with EventBridge, then if there is any issue will send me a notification.
To summarize the steps:


1. Create an Amazon SNS topic: Will send you the notifications issues.
2. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule: The new rule that listens for health events from your health dashboard and routes them to the SNS topic.
3. Configure your health dashboard to send health events to EventBridge: Configure the rule.
4. Test the setup: I used the AWS Management Console to publish a sample event to EventBridge and verified that the event is correctly matched by the EventBridge rule and that a notification is sent to the SNS topic.

## The Well Architected Tool

The Well-Architected Tool in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is designed to help us to review architecture and identify areas for improvement, based on the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization and Sustainability.

I was able to determine my priorities and the assess of my workload based on the six piller of AWS Well-Architected and determine where I can make some improvements to optimize your architecture:

1. Started by reviewing the existing architecture of your workload and identify any areas that may be lacking in one or more of the six pillars.
2. Prioritized the areas for improvement based on the potential impact and the likelihood of occurrence. For example, if you have a high likelihood of a security breach and a high impact, then security should be your top priority.
3. Assess the effort required to make the improvements, including time, resources, and budget.
4. Based on the results of the assessment, prioritize the areas that have the highest impact and the lowest effort to implement.
5. Regularly re-assess your priorities to ensure that they are aligned with your business objectives and evolving technology landscape.

## Architecture Diagram and Napkin

As mentioned in the prerequirements, I opened a Lucidchart account and checked bundled AWS Icon set to be able to reproduce the diagram showed in the live stream session.

## AWS service limits

These are the most common Service limits in AWS and the RDS seems more like to be a service that I would open the ticket, because it is more related to our project: 

+ Amazon EC2 instance limits: EC2 instance limits determine the maximum number of instances you can run in your account. If you need to run more instances than your current limit allows, you can request an increase in the limit. However, if your use case requires many instances, it may be necessary to re-architect your application to use EC2 auto-scaling or to use EC2 instances in different regions or accounts.

+ Amazon S3 bucket limits: S3 bucket limits determine the maximum number of buckets you can create in your account. If you need to store more data than your current limit allows, you can request an increase in the limit. Alternatively, you can store your data in multiple S3 buckets or use S3 storage classes to store data that is less frequently accessed.

+ Amazon RDS database limits: RDS database limits determine the maximum number of databases you can run, the size of the databases, and the number of connections to the databases. If you need to run more databases than your current limit allows, you can request an increase in the limit. Alternatively, you can use Amazon Aurora or Amazon DynamoDB for larger database workloads or use RDS in multiple regions or accounts.

+ Amazon VPC limits: VPC limits determine the maximum number of VPCs you can create the number of subnets in a VPC, and the number of security groups in a VPC. If you need to create more VPCs or subnets than your current limit allows, you can request an increase in the limit. Alternatively, you can use VPC peering or VPN connections to connect multiple VPCs.

+ Amazon Lambda function limits: Lambda function limits determine the maximum number of functions you can run, the number of concurrent executions, and the amount of memory that can be allocated to a function. If you need to run more functions or allocate more memory than your current limit allows, you can request an increase in the limit. Alternatively, you can use multiple Lambda functions or use Amazon Fargate to run containerized workloads.

## Support ticket

I wrote a ticket to AWS support requesting a service limited for RDS, incase the users increases so fast that our RDS with not able to handle it any more.

## Billing alarm and Budget

I was able to setup the billing alarm and the budget through the CLI using Gitpod and did the commint so the changes are reflected in Github. If you need to see the proof of it please visit my assets folder.
