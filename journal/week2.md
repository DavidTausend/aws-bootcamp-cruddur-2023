# Week 2 — Distributed Tracing

Distributed tracing is a method of monitoring and understanding complex distributed systems, which are systems composed of many interconnected components that work together to provide a service. In distributed tracing, each request or transaction is tracked across all the components it touches, allowing developers and operators to trace the path of the request as it travels through the system.

A distributed tracing system typically consists of three main components:

1. Instrumentation: This involves adding code to the application to capture information about each request and its path through the system. This information is usually captured as a series of timed events and attributes, known as spans, which are associated with a unique identifier called a trace ID.

2. Trace collection: This involves collecting the spans generated by the instrumentation and sending them to a central repository or database for storage and analysis.

3. Trace analysis: This involves analyzing the collected traces to identify patterns, diagnose problems, and optimize the performance of the system. This can involve visualizing the trace data as a graph or timeline, searching for specific events or attributes, and using statistical analysis or machine learning to identify anomalies or trends.
Distributed tracing is especially useful for microservices architectures, where services are typically deployed as independent units and communicate with each other over a network. In such systems, problems can arise due to network delays, service failures, or misconfigured components, and it can be challenging to diagnose the root cause of a problem without a complete view of the request path.

By using distributed tracing, developers and operators can gain insights into the health and performance of the entire system, rather than just individual components. This can help to identify and fix problems quickly, improve the overall user experience, and ensure the reliability and scalability of the system.

## Homework



## Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend[HARD]

I wasn't able to accomplish the challenge, but I tried. There is some code in the application.Therefore, I will try again in the future.

## Add Notifications span

I added a span for the notifications in  to trace if the users are able to receive the update notification. Here is the example.

from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer("notifications.activities")

class NotificationsActivities:

  def run():
  
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("notifications-activities-mock-data"):
    
      span = trace.get_current_span()
      
      now = datetime.now(timezone.utc).astimezone()
      
      span.set_attribute("notifications.now", now.isoformat())  
      
      span.set_attribute("notifications.result_lenght", len(results))

##  Save queries in Honeycomb dasboard

1. Log in to your Honeycomb account and navigate to the dataset you want to query.
2. Click on the "Run Query" button in the top middle of the screen.
3. In the query editor, write your custom query using Honeycomb's query language. You can use the autocomplete and syntax highlighting features to help you write your query.
4. Once you have written your query, click on the "Run Query" button to execute it.
5. If the query returns the results you expect, you can give it a name clicking the "add name and description" and then save the query for later use by clicking on the "Star ⭐️"in the top middle of the screen.
In the "Save to board" select your dashboard and click "Save" to save the query.
6. To see the query, go the board and select it.
